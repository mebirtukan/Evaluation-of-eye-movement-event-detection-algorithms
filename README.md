# Evaluation of eye movement event detection algorithms
Different eye movment event detection algorithms are evaluated and compared. 
Human coders, I_VT(Velocity Threshold Identification), I_DT(Dispersion Threshold Identification), RF(Random Forest) and CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) event classification methods are evaluated and compared in unifor way.
